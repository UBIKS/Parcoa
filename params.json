It is released under a MIT license.\r\n\r\nFor an overview of Parcoa's functionality read the project [README](https://raw.github.com/brotchie/Parcoa/master/README.md).\r\n\r\n- Primitive parsers for consuming unicode characters and strings can be found in [Parcoa+Primitives.h](https://github.com/brotchie/Parcoa/blob/master/Parcoa/Parcoa%2BPrimitives.h).\r\n- Parser Combinators for combining these parsers can be found in [Parcoa+Combinators.h](https://github.com/brotchie/Parcoa/blob/master/Parcoa/Parcoa%2BCombinators.h).\r\n","name":"Parcoa"}
